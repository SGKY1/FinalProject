# FinalProject
Dataset and code used in my STAT0035 final project.

Here you can find the datasets needed to run the codebook which includes graphical output and analysis results that are mentioned in the paper.
There is a HTML file of outputs for the user's convenience as well as the original Jupyter notebook that all code was run in.
